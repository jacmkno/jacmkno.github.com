    <h1>Thinking of a new way to display content</h1>
    <p>
    It´s sad that after so many years of creating web content 
    we humans have not been able to achieve a way of content 
    navigation that can at least be close to the dreams that
    movie directors imagined in movies like Minority Report or
    Star Trek for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
    HTML has been a great way to give basic structure to our content
    in the past 30 years but it looks like there has been almost no
    creativity from it's start in the way of displaying it. Moreover
    there has been very sadly succesful attempts to degradate what was
    achieved by it in the sense of standarizing the way we structure content,
    and I'm talking about things like JSX that try to make people forget
    about the importance of standard content structural elements and bringing
    us all back to think chaotically about content structure.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thinking about this, I wonder how can we introduce new elements on
    content navigation and displaying by using the wonderful new tools
    we have available today like accelerometers, CSS3 3D transformations,
    touch screens, microphone access, webrtc, etc... But I don't think
    about it with the idea of creating a single piece of content that 
    just looks cool because of these elements, so you can have fun with it
    and then forget it. I think about developing and testing a new 
    mechanisms that can integrate these elements in the visualization
    of any website, allowing visitors to navigate in a completely now
    modern way by giving new rich functions and reinterpretations to the
    HTML that can actually help people to understant, interact and digest
    content in a faster, funer and more efficient way.
    </p>
    <p>I´ll go ahead, and try to create a script that can display this page in a new fun way and see how it goes.</p>
    <p>And at the same time I'll be testing this feature of github pages that I have been ignoring for so long....<p>
